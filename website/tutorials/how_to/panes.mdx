Lightweight Chartsâ„¢ allows you to create multiple panes in a single chart.

Using multiple panes in a charting library can be incredibly useful for a variety of analytical and visualization scenarios,
especially when dealing with complex datasets or requiring detailed comparative analysis across different data dimensions.

This example shows how to use panes in Lightweight Charts. We will create a chart with two panes, one for the main series and another for the candles.

You can see a full [working example](#full-example) below.

## How to add a pane

To introduce an additional pane into a chart, specify the `paneIndex` during series creation
or later by invoking the [`moveToPane`](/docs/next/api/interfaces/ISeriesApi#movetopane) method on the series instance.

```js
const volumeSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries(
    {
        priceFormat: {
            type: 'volume',
        },
    },
    1
); // Specifying the pane index as the 2nd argument
// Alternatively, you can move the series to a different pane via the moveToPane method
// note that if pane with index 2 doesn't exist, it will be created
volumeSeries.moveToPane(2);
```

If a series is moved out of a pane and no other series remain, the pane will be automatically removed.

### Customisations

Lightweight Charts provides few option to customize the panes. You can set the pane separator color by setting the `separatorColor` property on the
[`layout.panes`](/docs/next/api/interfaces/LayoutPanesOptions) chart options, and `separatorHoverColor` to change the color when the mouse is over the separator.
And you can disable resizing of the panes by setting the `enableResize` property to `false`, by default it is set to `true`.

```js
chart.applyOptions({
    layout: {
        panes: {
            separatorColor: '#ff0000',
            separatorHoverColor: '#00ff00',
            enableResize: false,
        },
    },
});
```

Additionaly we can control each pane via the [`PaneApi`](/docs/next/api/interfaces/IPaneApi). It has few methods to get some data about the pane,
like `getHeight()` to get height of current pane, `paneIndex()` to get pane index, `getSeries()`
to get list of series displayed on the pane and also contains methods manipulate the pane like `setHeight(height)` and `moveTo(paneIndex)`.

To get the `PaneApi` instance, you need to call the `panes` method on the `ChartApi` instance, it returns an array of `PaneApi` instances.
Let's say we want to set the height of the second pane to 300px and move it to the first position.

```js
const secondPane = chart.panes()[1];
secondPane.setHeight(300);
secondPane.moveTo(0);
```

Note: minimum pane height is 30px so if you set height less than 30px it will be set to 30px.

To remove the pane you can call the `removePane(paneIndex)` method on the `ChartApi` instance.

```js
chart.removePane(1);
```

Note: Removing a pane also removes any series contained within it.
