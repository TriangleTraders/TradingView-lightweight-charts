This example illustrates the creation of a range switcher in Lightweight Chartsâ„¢
that allows for changing the data set displayed based on a selected time range
or interval. Different data sets representing ranges such as daily ('1D'),
weekly ('1W'), monthly ('1M'), and yearly ('1Y') are prepared.

The chart begins with daily data displayed by default. Then, buttons
corresponding to each predefined interval are created. When a user clicks one of
these buttons, the `setChartInterval` function is called with the chosen
interval, swapping the currently displayed data series with the one
corresponding to the chosen interval. Consequently, the viewers can quickly
switch between different timeframes, providing flexible analysis of the data
trends.
